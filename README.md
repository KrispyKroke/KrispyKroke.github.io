## Distance to Galaxy Collision
By Jared Kroke (Project for a friend's website)
### Description
The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are on a collision course and will intersect many years from now.  This is just a fun project commissioned by a buddy for his website.  It is a front-end only application using React to display a miles remaining ticker for when the two galaxies will collide.  The remaining miles are recalculated every second and updated on the DOM.  Because it deals with distances on the intergalactic scale, a certain degree of precision is sacrificed, so visitors to the site should understand that it is a fairly accurate but ultimately rough estimate.  Enjoy!
